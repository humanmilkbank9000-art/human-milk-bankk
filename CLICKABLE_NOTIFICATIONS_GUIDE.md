# Clickable Notifications - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature: Clickable Notifications with Smart Routing

Notifications are now **clickable** and automatically redirect users to the relevant section based on the notification type and user role.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### User Clicks Notification ‚Üí

1. **Notification is automatically marked as read**
2. **User is redirected to the appropriate page**
3. **Badge count updates**
4. **Dropdown closes**

## üìç Redirect Mapping

### For Admin Notifications:

| Notification Title Contains    | Redirects To                | Route                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "Health Screening"             | Health Screening Management | `admin.health-screening` |
| "Donation" + "Walk-in"         | Donation Management         | `admin.donation`         |
| "Donation" + "Home Collection" | Donation Management         | `admin.donation`         |
| "Breastmilk Request"           | Request Management          | `admin.request`          |

### For User Notifications:

| Notification Title Contains | Redirects To          | Route                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "Health Screening"          | Health Screening Form | `user.health-screening` |
| "Donation"                  | Pending Donations     | `user.pending`          |
| "Pickup"                    | Pending Donations     | `user.pending`          |
| "Request"                   | My Requests           | `user.my-requests`      |

## üíª Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Function - Smart Routing

```javascript
function getNotificationRedirectUrl(title, role) {
    const titleLower = title.toLowerCase();

    if (role === "admin") {
        // Admin notifications
        if (titleLower.includes("health screening")) {
            return "/admin/health-screening";
        } else if (titleLower.includes("donation")) {
            return "/admin/donation";
        } else if (titleLower.includes("breastmilk request")) {
            return "/admin/request";
        }
    } else {
        // User notifications
        if (titleLower.includes("health screening")) {
            return "/user/health-screening";
        } else if (
            titleLower.includes("donation") ||
            titleLower.includes("pickup")
        ) {
            return "/user/pending-donation";
        } else if (titleLower.includes("request")) {
            return "/user/my-requests";
        }
    }

    return null;
}
```

### Click Handler

```javascript
async function handleNotificationClick(notificationId, redirectUrl) {
    // Mark as read
    await fetch(`/notifications/${notificationId}/read`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "X-CSRF-TOKEN": csrfToken },
    });

    // Redirect
    window.location.href = redirectUrl;
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Visual Feedback:

1. **Cursor Changes**

    - Pointer cursor on hover (indicates clickable)
    - Normal cursor for non-clickable items

2. **Hover Effect**

    - Light gray background on hover
    - Smooth transition (0.2s)

3. **Active State**

    - Slightly darker background when clicked
    - Provides tactile feedback

4. **Mark Button**
    - Still available for manual marking
    - Prevents event propagation (won't trigger redirect)

### CSS Styling:

```css
.notification-item {
    transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
}

.notification-item[style*="cursor: pointer"]:hover {
    background-color: #f8f9fa !important;
}

.notification-item[style*="cursor: pointer"]:active {
    background-color: #e9ecef !important;
}
```

## üîç Smart Detection Logic

The system intelligently detects notification type by analyzing the **title** text:

### Keywords Used:

-   **"health screening"** ‚Üí Routes to health screening pages
-   **"donation"** ‚Üí Routes to donation management
-   **"walk-in"** ‚Üí Routes to donation management
-   **"home collection"** ‚Üí Routes to donation management
-   **"pickup"** ‚Üí Routes to pending donations (user)
-   **"breastmilk request"** ‚Üí Routes to request pages
-   **"request"** ‚Üí Routes to my requests (user)

### Case Insensitive:

-   All comparisons are case-insensitive
-   "Health Screening" = "health screening" = "HEALTH SCREENING"

---
