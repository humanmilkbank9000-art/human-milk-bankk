-   [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Enter to submit)

### Medium Term

-   [ ] Rich text editor for notes (bold, italic, lists)
-   [ ] Notes templates for common scenarios
-   [ ] Batch operations (accept/decline multiple requests)
-   [ ] Print-friendly view of request details

### Long Term

-   [ ] Notes history/audit trail
-   [ ] Email preview before sending decline notification
-   [ ] Integration with calendar for follow-ups

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **SweetAlert Dependency**: Requires CDN access (fallback provided)
2. **Auto-Reload**: May lose unsaved work in other tabs
3. **Character Limit**: 1000 characters (could be increased if needed)
4. **No Undo**: Decline action is immediate (consider confirmation)

**Note:** None of these are critical issues and workarounds exist.

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### If Issues Arise:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify SweetAlert CDN**: Ensure CDN is accessible
3. **Check CSRF Token**: Token must be present and valid
4. **Review Laravel Logs**: Check `storage/logs/laravel.log`
5. **Test Fallback Mode**: Disable SweetAlert to test basic functionality

### Common Fixes:

**Issue:** SweetAlert not showing
**Fix:** Clear browser cache, check CDN access

**Issue:** Decline fails silently
**Fix:** Check CSRF token, verify admin session

**Issue:** Notes not saving
**Fix:** Check character limit (1000), verify form field name
