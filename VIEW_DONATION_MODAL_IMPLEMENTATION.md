# View Donation Modal Implementation

## Overview
Added a modal to display donation details in the Walk-in Success tab when clicking the "View" button in the admin's breastmilk donation management page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Controller Method (`app/Http/Controllers/DonationController.php`)
- Added `show($id)` method to fetch and return donation details as JSON
- Returns donor information, bag details, volumes, dates, and times
- Handles bag_details parsing from JSON if stored as string
- Includes error handling with proper logging

#### Route (`routes/web.php`)
- Added GET route: `/admin/donations/{id}` 
- Route name: `admin.donation.show`
- Maps to `DonationController@show` method

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Modal Design (`resources/views/admin/breastmilk-donation.blade.php`)
Added a new modal with the following sections:
- **Header**: Pink gradient background matching the provided design ("Walk-In Donation Success")
- **Donor Information Section**: Shows name, contact, and address in a gray background box
- **Summary Section**: Displays total bags and total volume
- **Bag Details Table**: Shows detailed information for each bag:
  - Bag number
  - Volume (ml)
  - Date
  - Time
- **Loading State**: Spinner shown while fetching data
- **Error State**: Alert message if data fetch fails

#### JavaScript Functionality
Added event handler for `.view-donation` button click:
- Fetches donation details via AJAX from `/admin/donations/{id}`
- Shows loading spinner during fetch
- Populates modal with received data
- Handles bag details dynamically:
  - If bag_details exists, uses that data
  - If not, generates default rows with 120ml volumes
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Modal reset on close to prevent stale data

### 3. Features
- **Responsive Design**: Modal works on all screen sizes
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches fresh data each time the view button is clicked
- **User-Friendly**: Clear loading states and error messages
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing modal patterns in the application
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA labels and roles

## How to Use
1. Navigate to Admin â†’ Breastmilk Donation Management
2. Go to the "Walk-in Success" tab
3. Click the "View" button on any donation record
4. The modal will open showing complete donation details
5. Click "Close" or the X button to dismiss the modal

## Technical Notes
- Modal ID: `viewDonationModal`
- Uses Bootstrap 5 modal component
- jQuery for AJAX and DOM manipulation
- Data is fetched fresh on each view (not cached)
- Compatible with existing table and card layouts

## Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/DonationController.php` - Added show() method
2. `routes/web.php` - Added GET route for donation details
3. `resources/views/admin/breastmilk-donation.blade.php` - Added modal HTML and JavaScript

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with donations that have bag_details
2. Test with donations without bag_details (older records)
3. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
4. Test error handling by temporarily breaking the route
5. Verify data accuracy by comparing with database records
