USER WALK-IN CALENDAR DEBUG GUIDE
===================================

I've added debug logging to help identify the mismatch between admin and user calendars.

STEPS TO DEBUG:

1. Clear browser cache and compiled views:
   ```
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

2. Open your browser and press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to the Console tab

3. Log in as a USER and navigate to: /user/donate

4. Click "Walk-in Donation" button to open the modal

5. In the DevTools Console, you'll see output like:
   ```
   === USER Walk-in Calendar Rendering ===
   Current Month/Year: 10 2025
   Available Dates Array: ["2025-11-01", "2025-11-02", ...]
   Date: 2025-11-01, isAvailable: true, isPast: false
   ✅ HIGHLIGHTED: 2025-11-01
   Date: 2025-11-02, isAvailable: true, isPast: false
   ✅ HIGHLIGHTED: 2025-11-02
   ...
   === USER Calendar Render Complete ===
   ```

6. Now open admin dashboard: /admin/dashboard
   - The admin calendar also has similar debug logging
   - Compare the "Available Dates Array" between admin and user

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

A. Check if availableDates array is identical:
   - Admin shows: ["2025-11-01", "2025-11-02", ...]
   - User shows: ["2025-11-01", "2025-11-02", ...]
   - If arrays match, the backend is correct

B. Check which dates get highlighted (✅):
   - Look for lines like "✅ HIGHLIGHTED: 2025-11-01"
   - Compare which dates are marked as available between admin/user

C. Check for date string format issues:
   - Make sure dates are "YYYY-MM-DD" format (not "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00")

COMMON ISSUES:

1. If admin shows dates but user shows empty array:
   - Controller isn't passing $availableDates correctly

2. If arrays match but highlights differ:
   - Date comparison logic differs (isPast calculation, timezone)

3. If dates have different format:
   - One calendar uses Date objects, other uses strings

SHARE WITH ME:

Copy and paste the console output showing:
- The "Available Dates Array" from BOTH admin and user
- Any dates that show different isAvailable values
- Any error messages in the console

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!
